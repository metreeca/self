Metreeca/Self is a linked data search and visualization tool enabling interactive exploration of SPARQL endpoints.

It features a streamlined and intuitive interface, built around very familiar concepts like tables, faceted filtering,
drag&drop, link navigation and charting.

It may be deployed as a standalone client-side web app or embedded into web sites and data portals to power user-friendly
faceted catalogs, linked data navigation and data-driven infographics.
