# Getting Involved

Code patches are not the only way to get involved: you can help the project by [reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs);
improving docs; helping others on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/metreeca/self/issues); tweeting
to [@metreeca](https://twitter.com/metreeca); telling the world about Metreeca ;-)

# Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug on the project's [issues](https://github.com/metreeca/self/issues) page, search already reported
issues for similar cases and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.

If you've really found a new bug, creating a helpful report using the dedicated template will make fixing it much easier
and quicker.

If you just want some help with the toolkit or your project, have a look at [support](README.md#support) options.

# Suggesting Features

If you think you have a good idea about improving or extending Metreeca/Self, feel free to open a ticket on the
project's [issues](https://github.com/metreeca/self/issues) page, using the dedicated template.

Again search already reported suggestions and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.
