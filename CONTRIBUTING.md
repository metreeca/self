# Getting Involved

Code patches are absolutely welcome. However, they're not the only way to get involved: you can help the project by
reporting bugs; improving docs; helping others on [GitHub Issues](issues); tweeting
to [@metreeca](https://twitter.com/metreeca); telling the world about Metreeca ;-)

# Reporting Bugs

Before opening an [issue](https://github.com/metreeca/self/issues) to report a bug, search open issues for similar cases
and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.

If you've really found a new bug, creating a helpful report that will make fixing it much easier and quicker:

If you just want some help with the tool or your project, start
a [conversation](https://github.com/metreeca/self/discussions) and describe your problem.

# Suggesting Features

If you think you have a good idea about improving or extending Metreeca/Self, feel free to open
an [issues](https://github.com/metreeca/self/issues), using the dedicated template.

Again search open suggestions and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.
