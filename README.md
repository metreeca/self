Metreeca/Self is a self-service linked data search and analysis tool enabling business users to visually interact with SPARQL endpoints.

It features a streamlined and intuitive interface, built around very familiar concepts like tables, faceted filtering, drag&drop and link navigation.

It may be deployed as a standalone web app or embedded into web sites and data portals to power user-friendly faceted catalogs, linked data navigation and data-driven infographics.
