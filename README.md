# Metreeca/Self

Metreeca/Self is a self-service linked data search and analysis tool enabling business users to visually interact with SPARQL endpoints.

It features a streamlined and intuitive interface, built around very familiar concepts like tables, faceted filtering, drag&drop, link navigation and charting.

It may be deployed as a standalone client-side web app or embedded into web sites and data portals to power user-friendly faceted catalogs, linked data navigation and data-driven infographics.

To get started with Metreeca/Self, open the [docs](https://metreeca.github.io/self/) and walk through the [search and analysis](https://metreeca.github.io/self/tutorials/search-and-analysis) tutorial.
